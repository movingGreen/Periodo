        <h1>HTML basics</h1>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
        </p>
        <h6>So what is HTML?</h6>
        <p>
            HTML is a <i>markup language</i> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element" target="_blank">elements</a>, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing a
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag"  target="_blank">tags</a> can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
        </p>
        <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h6>Anatomy of an HTML element</h6>
        <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
            </li>
            <li>
                The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
            </li>
            <li>
                The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
            </li>
            <li>
                The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
